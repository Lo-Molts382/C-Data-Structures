This repository contains eight (8) mini-project files in the C language 
following activities regarding Data Structures and Algorithms 
which supplement discussions during my sophomore year taking up a 
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. 

The C files you will see are about arrays, stacks, and queues, and the different methods of implementation available.
